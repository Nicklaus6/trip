## Settings
### Low Network Mode

*Low Network Mode* is enabled by default. When enabled, the app displays the Category image instead of the Place image to reduce network usage. You can disable this mode in the settings if you prefer to load Place images directly.


## Place Creation
### Google Maps URL Parsing

You can paste a link from Google Maps into the `place` input when creating a Place.

It will automatically fill the `Name`, `Place`, `Latitude` and `Longitude` from the link.

Try it yourself with this URL: `https://www.google.com/maps/place/British+Museum/@51.5194166,-0.1295315,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x48761b323093d307:0x2fb199016d5642a7!8m2!3d51.5194133!4d-0.1269566`.

To have this, you can either *click* on a Point of Interest in Google Maps or *search* for one, then copy the URL.


### LatLng Parsing

You can paste a LatLng coordinate into the `latitude` input when creating a Place.

Supported formats include examples like:
- `37.7749, -122.4194`
- `37.7749° N, 122.4194° W`
- `37°46'29.64" N, 122°25'9.84" W`
- `37°46.494' N, 122°25.164' W`

### Plus Code Parsing

You can paste a [Plus Code](https://maps.google.com/pluscodes/) into the `latitude` input when creating a Place.

Example: `849VCWC8+R9`

## Trip

### Display a day itinerary

In addition to displaying the full trip itinerary using the button above the table, you can view the itinerary for a single day by clicking on that day's name in the table.  

This will show only the itinerary for the selected day.
